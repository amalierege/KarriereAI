# KarriereAI
## Project Brief
KarriereAI is a machine learning model designed to determine a suitable technological career path for a user based on their skills and interests.
This is a project done through the course Deep Learning Engineering at Western Norway University of Applied Sciences. 
The report  written in accordance with this model implementation is a part of the final-grade of said course.

## Purpose
The purpose and goal of this neural network is to predict a fitting job title based on input from a user through an interactive quiz. 
The quiz is designed to define the user's skills, and will forward said skills to the model to make predictions on them. 
This is a part of a bachelor's project implemented in Vue.js front-end framework, which will be used to deploy the model.

## Model Architecture and Implementation
The model is a feed-forward neural network (FNN) implemented through a simple sequential network of dense layers, working as a classifier of skills to job titles in the tech market. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for training contains job titles which are matched up against relevant skills. 
The file itself is from Van-Duyet (et al., 2019), which is a dataset used in a sub-part of their Skills2vec model architecture.

## How to Recreate and Run the Model
TBD.
